I am a Computer Science & Engineering Graduate from one of India's premier institutes i.e. Indian Institute of Infomation Technology, Design & Manufacturing.

I have a keen interest in Design, and Software Development, hence I developed skills in Design(Adobe Suite) And front-end technologies like Javascript, React, and Vue.

In my career of 5+ years, I have built projects from scratch which now serve 1000s of people/customers, and the number is still growing.
Right now I am leading a team of size 5 including 3 developers and 2 QAs, handling all aspects including Backend, Frontend, and QA.

I love watching Sitcoms, Space, and History documentaries in my free time.
